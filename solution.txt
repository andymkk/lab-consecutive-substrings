Algorithm: Nested loop substring generation
Approach: Two pointers generate all consecutive substrings

result = []
for i = 0 to n-1:
  for j = i+1 to n:
    result.append(str[i:j])
return result

Time Complexity: O(n³)
Why: n(n+1)/2 substrings, each copy costs O(k), total = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 → O(n³)
Space: O(n³) for storing all substrings
